# Four-Function Calculator Console Application

## Description
This project is a basic four-function calculator built as a console application in C#. It performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the userâ€™s input.

## Features
- **Addition**: Adds two numbers and returns the result.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first and returns the result.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second, and returns the result (with error handling for division by zero).

## How to Use
1. The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
2. The user selects an operation to perform: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division).
3. The program performs the chosen operation and displays the result.
4. The user can continue performing calculations or exit the program.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code or any C# IDE.
3. Run the application by pressing `F5` or using the terminal/console to execute:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
Follow the prompts to enter numbers and select an operation.
## Example Output
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+ - * /): *
Result: 50
Or
Enter first number: 15
Enter second number: 3
Enter operation (+ - * /): /
Result: 5
## Files
Program.cs: Contains the logic for taking input from the user, performing arithmetic operations, and displaying the result.
Error Handling
